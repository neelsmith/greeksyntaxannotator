## Summary


**Contents**:

- `syntaxannotator.html`: current draft of web app.

## Caveats

The web app was written entirely by gemini-2.5-pro. The code passes some sanity tests, but I have not even looked at the javascript. When I encountered errors, I let gemini fix them. Use the code as you like, but be aware that I have no idea what it does or how it works.
